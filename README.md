## Getting started üöÄ
Slidecontrol's extension is available in
the [Chrome webstore](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/slidecontrol/ghfjfgbiehcemjfapohnnfngcbappodg) or
by installing it locally (clone `/slide-control-extension` and add it to `chrome://extensions`).

Following the steps after installation will lead you to our PWA `/slide-control-pwa`, available
at [slidecontrol.niveri.xyz](https://sc.niveri.xyz).
